# OOP EXAMPLE with JS

The classes (parent and children) can be found in the [OOP](https://github.com/Tozarf/OOP-with-Javascript-/tree/main/OOP) folder. Nonetheless, their instantiation and the whole execution of the testsbelongs to the [tests](to be defined) folder.

## Testing

Use the following command to run the program.(Make sure you are pointing to one of the tests files)

```bash
node <test file relative path>
```

## Disclaimer

This example was created as a task, therefore, academic purposes. It should not be used as an ultimate guide on how Object Oriented Programming works on Javascript. (At least not until I get my passing grade :) )
